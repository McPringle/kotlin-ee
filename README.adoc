*This repository contains the source code of my live demo which is a part of my https://www.fihlon.ch/talks/abstracts/kotlin-ee/[Kotlin EE: Boost Your Productivity] talk.*

== Build

We use https://gradle.org/[Gradle] to build the two services. You can start the multi project build with just one command in the root folder:

```bash
./gradlew assemble
```

== Docker

To create the https://www.docker.org/[Docker] images for the two services, you have to run the following two commands:

```
docker build -t test/timeservice timeservice
docker build -t test/helloservice helloservice
```

If you want to push these images to the https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] registry, you can replace the `test` prefix with your own https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] user or organization name.
